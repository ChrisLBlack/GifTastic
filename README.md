# GifTastic
This simple project showcases my knowlege in API requests.  

The app takes user input, forms an API and requests JSON data from the Giphy API.  It then adds gifs to the DOM in a still state.  When the user clicks on the gif, it plays, and when they click again it pauses the gif. 

The user input is also formed into a button, that can be clicked on at a later point to still function as previous functionality.
